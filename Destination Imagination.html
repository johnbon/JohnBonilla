	Destination Imagination (D.I.) has become a big part of my life over the last three years. When someone asks, “What is Destination Imagination?” or “What do you do in Destination Imagination?” It is one of the hardest things to communicate to a person. The best and only way to explain it, is by going through the experience. In basic terms it’s an organization that promotes students to use their talents, learn, and present their solution to the teams chosen challenge, but it’s so much more. This program brings out the strengths and weaknesses in a person, forces students to learn and innovate, shows them different careers that may be interested in, and the list continues, but the most important thing that D.I. brings about is a sense of belonging. 
To give an overview of how the competition works is as follows. A group of seven students are formed into a team, with a team manager to provide guidance. From here students are given the choice to choose between six different challenges:
-	Technical
-	Structural
-	Improvisational
-	Fine Arts
-	Scientific
-	Service Learning
The requirements and guidelines that these challenges entail differ from year to year, some more than others. Once a challenge is chosen, students use the rest of the time before competition to devise a solution to their challenge and create it. Once competition day has arrived students bring their solutions to the presentation sight and deliver their products to the judges. Once all the different teams from the regional area has competed, students are presented with their scores and their placement within the competition. If the teams are placed either first or second, they are invited to complete on a global scale. Over the following two months these teams are pushed to making their solutions better, be more creative with their approach and fix any issues found. 
Starting from the beginning of sophomore year, I decided to join DI as most of my friends were already a part of the program and I was familiar with it since I had participated while I was in the sixth grade. Before then I would have just as been willing to join DI, however there were always issues. I went in with a cocky attitude, thinking I knew everything, could do anything, and hard headed. Never had I been more wrong. We had chosen the technical challenge that year which required us build a machine that could move a person across a sixteen feet wide gap. We had opted to build a hovercraft using a leaf blower to push up the underside of the vehicle. To push the vehicle, I believed we could use motors used for quadcopters to propel it forward. My managers trusted me, and so did my team, but it fell apart. I ended up burning up three of my own motors by delivering an excess number of amperes than it was rate for resulting in the destruction of these motors. Now if this hadn’t been bad enough my other solution which was moving the hovercraft with wheels ended up just as much of an issue as the quadcopter motor ideas because we could not find these motors in time for competition. Overall, I realized that there were so many precautions, and other options that we could have considered, but the motto is to live and learn. We ended up pulling the hovercraft across the expanse which was not a proper solution. This ended up putting us in last place for that year. I had felt so defeated, so drained, but where others would quit, I decided to continue D.I. which was one of the best choices I had ever made.
Moving to my Junior year, school had become harder forcing me to dedicate more time to my studies, but I was still determined to redeem myself. Our team, despite originally saying that we wouldn’t do the Technical Challenge again, chose the challenge again, however this time it required us to make a stage for us to perform on and create a mechanism that would be able to move a person. The difference between the year before and this year was that we did not have to move a person over an expanse, but instead just visibly show that a person had moved from one position to the next. I had become humbler with my ideas, always thinking about the feasibility of my pitch
